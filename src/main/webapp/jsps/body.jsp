    <h1>The idea is to study the type of violence that occurs, and understand how and why the violence occurs. We would collect data on what force is used, how many times the force was used, what infractions the suspect was charged with, the demographics that violence affects, and where the violence's occurs. This project is mostly focused on research value to change policy rather than peruse a product. However the data could be useful to create algorithms to trace high crime rate neighborhoods. Police/government entities could use the data to keep track of warrants and infractions of their suspects. The public would use this data to know what force the police use, and if its justified. What would make this database unique, is it can centralize all crime and violence data into one which can be used to study violence directly, as well as demographic disparities as well.</h1>
